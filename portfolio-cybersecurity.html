					<h3>CSUSB Cyber Security Open House</h3>
					<p>Members met at Cal State San Bernandino's Open House of their cybersecurity program. It was very informative and demonstrated the capabilities of the two computer science clubs at CSUSB: the <a href="https://www.infosec-csusb.org/">Information Security Club</a> and the <a href="https://cse-csusb.org/">Computer Science & Engineering Club.</a></p>
					<p>While many of our members are programming majors, several are looking at CSUSB for their cybersecurity program and/or cybersecurity as a future career. At the same time, our own campus is developing a cybersecurity program that will begin as a certification and hopefully eventually develop into a transfer program into CSUSB and other schools offering cybersecurity as a major.</p>
