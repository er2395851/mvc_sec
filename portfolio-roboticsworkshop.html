					<h3>Robotics Workshops</h3>
					<p>The workshops are designed to introduce attendees to robotics by holding a brief lecture about basic robotics concepts and allowing them to participate in a hands-on demonstration.</p>
					<p>In a previous workshop, the activities that participants completed were the Hour of Code, a nationwide initiative to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming, and the "Hello, World!" of physical computing which is programming an Arduino, a widely used microcontroller, using its IDE to get an LED light to flash and demonstrate how you can program it to flash every second or every minute.</p>
