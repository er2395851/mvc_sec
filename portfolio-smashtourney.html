					<h3>Video Game Tournaments</h3>
					<p>The community gathers at Moreno Valley College in the Student Academic Services building to compete in video game tournaments.</a></p>
					<p>We open the event not only to MVC students but the local community as well. We often see high school students who are looking at MVC as their next step in education and try to recruit those interested in computer science into the club once they have been admitted to Moreno Valley College.</p>
					<p>Like our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SECGamingTournaments">Gaming Tournament page</a> to get updates on upcoming tournaments. If interested, you can also help us organize a game event.</p>
