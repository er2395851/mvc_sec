					<h3>Club Rush</h3>
					<p>Every full-term semester we use past and future projects to entice not only computer science majors but those who are intrigued with technology to become involved with our club.</p>
					<p>Although, components of some of our projects require technical knowledge or the drive to obtain that knowledge. There are plenty of other positions and skills to obtain within our club such as public speaking, networking, and organizing.</p>
