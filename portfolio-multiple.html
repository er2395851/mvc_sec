Last year we sent a team to compete in the competition in hopes to challenge ourselves and improve our skills.</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.icpc2017.org/">This last year</a> we organized a team of committed members to take part in the competition under the Software Engineering Club name and while we weren't successful as we hoped, we learned a lot.</p>

					<p>Every full-term semester we use past and future projects to entice not only computer science majors but those who are intrigued with technology to become involved with our club.</p>
					<p>Although, components of some of our projects require technical knowledge or the drive to obtain that knowledge. There are plenty of other positions and skills to obtain within our club such as public speaking, networking, and organizing.</p>

					<h3>CSUSB Cyber Security Open House</h3>
					<p>Members met at Cal State San Bernandino's Open House of their Cyber Security program. It was very informative and demonstrated the capabilities of the two computer science clubs at CSUSB: the <a href="https://www.infosec-csusb.org/">Information Security Club</a> and the <a href="https://cse-csusb.org/">Computer Science & Engineering Club.</a></p>
					<p>While many of our members are programming majors, several are looking at CSUSB for their cyber security program and/or cyber security as a future career. At the same time, our own campus is developing a cyber security program that will begin as a certification and hopefully eventually develop into a transfer program into CSUSB and other schools offering cyber security as a major.</p>

					<h3>DARPA Robotics Convention</h3>
					<p>Members met at the <a href="http://archive.darpa.mil/roboticschallenge/">DARPA Robotics Convention</a>, an event which was a prize competition funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It aimed to develop semi-autonomous ground robots that could do "complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments" which would be extremely useful in assisting humans in responding to natural and man-made disasters.</a></p>
					<p>The DRC Finals competition challenged participating robotics teams and their robots to complete a difficult course of eight tasks relevant to disaster response, among them driving alone, walking through rubble, tripping circuit breakers, turning valves and climbing stairs.</p>
					<p>While many of robots seemed to have trouble when we watched some of the robots compete in the timed challenge. Many spectators, like us, were rooting for robots (and the teams behind them) to accomplish the above tasks as well as lamenting when they fell or failed to complete the task. While, the event was enjoyable for the spectators who appreciated the efforts of the teams behind these robots, it showed that we are still very far from the robots that we see in movies and television.</p>

					<p>The workshops are designed to give recommendations and to inform attendees about many common dangers they may face in dealing with computers.</p>
					<p>The presentations focused on common attacks like phishing and malware, stressed the importance of having a good password as well as changing it every 3-6 months, updating software and the operating system, and keeping only one antivirus as well as making sure it routinuely checks your system, and how to keep themselves safe on public networks such as the campus itself.</p>

					<p>The workshops are designed to introduce attendees to robotics by holding a brief lecture about basic robotics concepts and allowing them to participate in a hands-on demonstration.</p>
					<p>In a previous workshop, the activities that participants completed were the Hour of Code, a nationwide initiative to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming, and the "Hello, World!" of physical computing which is programming an Arduino using its IDE to get an LED light to flash and demonstrate how you can program it to flash every second or every minute.</p>

					<p>The community gathers at Moreno Valley College in the Student Activities Center to compete in a Super Smash Bros. for Wii U tournament.</a></p>
					<p>We open the event not only to MVC students but the local community as well. We often see high school students who are looking at MVC as their next step in education and try to recruit those interested in computer science into the club once they have been admitted to Moreno Valley College.</p>
